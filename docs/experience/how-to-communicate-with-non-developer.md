# How to communicate with Non-developer #

Why is it so hard to make ***non-tech background people*** understand even a simplest concept ? Or why is it so difficult to explain them the progress of your task ? I often thought that they have different mental structures but lately realized that was <s>my own myth</s>.

We often try to explain things as easy as possible so the audience can understand the concept. But mate, you can't explain every progress in development like that. There's a limit. And they don't like the feeling that they don't know it regardless it's not their major or main background. Or sometimes they just don't like to bother you. So they just nod and pretend understand. It's like just smiling or nodding without understanding when you listen to foreign language.

A simple example. You are trying to explain the concept of ***mutable***.

```javascript
var a = 1
a = 2
console.log(a) // the result is ?
```

It's not even questionable if you are a developer but if you are not, it's a very difficult question. They might say 3 or 1. So my point is, don't spend energy explain it. They don't have to know what mutable is

When an error occur, developers often try to explain why the error is occurred. But the business side is not really curious about all the logic behind the scene. What they are curious about is, how fast it can be fixed, how much time you need. Also, they don't care if it's from your mistake or the library you are using. They just want it to be away from the service. So customers won't winge about it(or make the service more stable ;)). Answer what they ask.

Sometimes business side ask how fast you can make the feature. It's always a difficult question to answer especially when you are not used to new library or frameworks. Or when you have to make frontend side as well while you are a server developer. They don't know the boundary between Backend and Frontend.

It's not a good idea to explain the difference between backend and frontend. If it unclear to predict the time that your team needed, you better discuss with your team members and divide the task as small as possible and calculate the time. When you set the developing time too long, management won't like it. But when you don't meet the deadline, you will lose their trust. So my advice is give it as **enough** time as possible. What I mean by 'enough' is as much as you can make safe test codes and deploy time. Even if you report the unexpected huddles to your business manager as fast as possible, delay is delay.

Think in their shoes. They may not like communicate with documentations. Most likely, they will prefer face to face conversation over Notion or slack. They believe they can learn more information when the conversation is made in person. And I totally agree with that. Words can't deliver much emotion or atmosphere. Or sometimes it's difficult to find the Slack threads.

My last advice, speak more with human not with machines. People often misunderstand development is working with computer. That's partially true but it's more human related. Most of the code you are writing is to provide human better service. In the end, it's better to know human better than your computer.


## Conclusion ##

1. Stop trying to explain the programming knowledge.
2. Use their language(Answer what they ask)
3. Think in their shoes
4. Talk more with human
