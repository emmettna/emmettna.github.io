**Brevity to say you don't know**

you can't know things before you try or have experience. But sometimes you are forced to have experience in order to have experience. Such a bizarre situation. Guess when it happens the most ?
Recruiting. And I had to go through as well.

Before I started my first programming job, I had zero background or experience of computer science nor coding. but most of the job descriptions required either experience or Computer Science degree. So at my first job, I pretended to I know how programming works or how I need to do things. But I had only vague ideas about what must be done in my job duty.

But in small StartUps, they actually don't have enough knowledge about programming. I have to say, you and your employer are at the same level. I only know a little more than them. Because I personally made an Android demo apps before. And it was no compare to Production level. But the position I applied for was Server Developer. So I can tell you that there was only one sheet difference between me and the recruiter.

Once you get on the stage, the Interview is pretty easy but you rarely get a chance to pitch.

My first job was really tough since they thought I know everything but like I said, I wasn't really ready. It was a spartan training for me. At least they weren't so strict about deadlines since they didn't have time to catch with me(in person). I only had to show once every week.

So I had sort of enough time to explore the new world. That's my first time coding Python. I used Django Framework and MySql for database. I didn't know about "Framework" but I really enjoyed using it. I spent much time reading Django References and as it's widely used, there were many  posts and Stackoverflow questions. I had to spend sometime looking for informations but didn't have any problem coding. I guess that's the beautify of Python. Easy to start for beginners.

So back to the topic again. If I said that I don't know much about Coding or Programming, Would they have me hired ? I don't think so. But you can express your ideas a little different way. Such as, You haven't had a chance to use Python but based on your Java experience, Connecting database with Python and Django framework doesn't seem so difficult.
It can show your enthusiasm. It can build more trust between you and the team

In my second job, my boss treated other developers stupid for not know things that developers were supposed to know. It was really bad environment for learning. He hired junior developers although he wanted to hire seniors, budgets were not allowed I guess.

It was difficult to tell him that something I don't know. I had to finish tasks which I didn't even comprehend. Source code got mess since I had to correct many times, and no test codes were written. If I had courage to ask him again or ask him to make a Jira ticket for the task, the team would've been more successful for sure.

Just say you don't know. You might feel like you are going to get fired for not know it? That's very unlikely. If I were in a position of managing your team, I would fire someone who says he knows but doesn't. As a manager I need to know what he/she is capable of and how long the task is going to take. It's a key interference of expectation.

Now I don't fear for saying I don't know. It was very difficult to say at first time. my first time was, "I'm not sure yet" although I obviously don't know what that was. So if you can't say it, go one by one. Your manager or boss clearly don't want him/her to lie. I guarantee you that
