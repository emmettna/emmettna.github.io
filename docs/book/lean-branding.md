- Jeremiah Gardner

## Summary
- As the title encompasses, the book tells why lean branding is the right tool for startups and big companies which want to innovate.
- Fast failure and quick feedback is the key
- Brand needs some part that communicate with client
- Let the **client be part** of what you are doing
- Client communication must be **mutual** not one way
- People fall in love with **stories** not logos all the product
- Don't fall into **feature hell(Field of Dreams)**
- Branding starts from the moment you tell your (business)idea to anybody
- Logo is just one component of the Branding method not the whole 

## What I liked about
- Different perspective of approaching branding
- Like lean startup, it tells stories with examples that include companies we know and we don't(right portions)
- Practical methods which I don't have to spend millions in marketing campaign

## What I didn't like about
- I Read in Korean translation and it was bad. **[Poor translation** in Korean](http://www.yes24.com/Product/Goods/71538741)
- Some examples don't fit in the situations

## Recommend to
- Someone who read Lean Startup
- Someone who doesn't have much knowledge in branding
- Someone who wants to try different approach
- Lean Fanatic

## Memo

### Branding
- None of two brands can go to a same path
- Brand **uniquely** represents you.

### Brand Experience
- Brand, Product, Culture all together integration provides the user experience
- All of the user experience is connected

### Development

- We think [people] will be [interested] in us because of [Reason]

### Story

#### Origin of activity
- You have story to tell clients and the story must be delivered in good form/shape/method/expression
#### Vision is overrated

- Unachievable vision is wasting time.
- Reasonable story telling is more likely to move client's mind.

#### Why-How-What
Think about
- **Why** you/your company needs to exist
    - Let people understand your product and service
- **How** you do it
    - How they benefit from it
- **What** you do
    - Capability of product

### Continuous Iteration

#### Word or Phrase
- Find a word or phrase that you want people to remember you as.
- Test and iterate and learn how people behave

### ETC
- Don't fall in to rules. There's no ultimate rules.
- Rules take you where someone else already been to. It's not the place you want to explore.
