## Memo

### Various Metrics

- In Start-up, it's unclear what data is meaningful and often meaningful data changes

### Good Matic

- Relevant, Comparable
- Easy to understand
- Representable in ratio
- Actionable(Something that can drive an action)

### Quantatative and Qualitative Metrics

- Quantatative metrics tells you what and how many
- Qualitative metrics answers you why

### Dream and Reality Metrics

- Data needs to give you a way to decide which way to go
- Better ask what you can do with that data(is this data actually meaningful?)
- 8 dream metrics(useless)
    1. Hits(visitings)
    2. Page Views
    3. Visitors
    4. Pure visitors
    5. Follows
    6. Station Period
    7. Collected emails
    8. Downloads

### Leading Indicator and Lagging Indicator

- In early stagy, there's no data to get leading indicators. Make dicisions with lagging data and start building cohort data for the longer term
- One department's lagging indicator can be another's leading indicator
- The purpose of leading indicator is to minimize misleadings in advance

### Core of Lean Analysis Is Test

- Analyze marketing effects, bounce rate, viral effects and etc with cohort chart

### What business to run

- Model business idea in lean canvans
- Don't tart a business which you will get bored soon
- Start only when you have an advantage than your competitors
- Try to answer 3 questions
    1. Is it worth solving
    2. Am I suggesting the right solution
    3. Really want to solve?

### One Core Indicator

- Start-up should seek one core objective
- OMTM(One Metric That Matters)
- OMTM answers to the most important question
- OMTM sets the clear goal
- OMTM makes company focus

### What type of business

- There are types of customers which may be beneficial or may not
- Understand whether if your business is focused on high retetion rate of low retention rate

### Business Steps

1. Empathy
2. Stickiness
3. Virality
4. Revunue
5. Scale
- Each step has different metrics to take care of
- Interview at least 15 people each step

### Empathy

- Get qualitative feedbak of pain point and solution

#### Finding a pain point

- Actual problem or inconvenient
- Many feel the same(market)
- Some already trying to solve
- Inverwiew points in Lean Startup
    - Face to Face
    - Neutral place like a cafe not office
    - Recording makes interviewee makes more careful(So it's a don't)
    - Prepare scripts (follow rules not amend)
- Just better UI won't get you anywhere. Be more creative and strategic

### Stickiness

- Rather than adding new features, iterate MVP, maintain and increase KPI
- Ask yourself if the new feature you are thinking will increase user stickiness
- User behavior is more important than user opinion
- User feedback often either sided. They don't leave feedback if service works the way they think
- Don't try to expend business before stisfy your business assumption which whether users want the service or feature
- Viral effect is greate but iteration speed is more important

### Revenue

- Sales per user is an important metric
- Even though every metric is perfect, if there is no sales, you will be forced to find another revenue model

### Scale

- Step to prove market
- if you focus on effectiveness, try to cut cost but if you focus on difference, try to increase revunue ratio
- Make youw own metrics based on strategy, tactics and execution

### Current Numbers

- Price is how much users are willing to pay not how much cost on your operation needs
- Rather than simple price comparision with competitors, try other methods like customer price sensitivity test
