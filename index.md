# Emmett's Tech Blog
---

This blog's main audience is myself.
the main purpose of my writing is to review and check again of my work when I run into the same obstacle again. We always make the same mistakes unfortunately.

And some experience to share things i didn't know when i was working as a sole developer and just a coder.

Hope you find some useful information if you are lost in tech.

Happy Coding :)
